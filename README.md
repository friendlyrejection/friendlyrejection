hello ðŸ‘‹ im FR
im trying to learn unity bcos one day i was out in the yard with the chickens
and i saw a bucket hanging from a tree and i thought "wouldnt it be cool if
there was a game about raising chickens that was kinda like a mix between 
rimworld and stardew valley" and i was right, that would be cool. but i couldnt
think of a way to get someone else to make it for me, so now i'm c#'s little
bitch until i figure out what im doing. this is literally the only reason im
learning how to code.
